# opencode-adapter

The **opencode** runtime for the [Language Operator](https://github.com/language-operator/language-operator),
running as a native Kubernetes workload.

It builds the runtime image and the Helm chart that registers the `opencode`
`LanguageAgentRuntime`. The opencode TUI runs inside tmux and is fronted by an
xterm.js / WebSocket terminal in the browser, so working with the agent feels like
a real terminal session.

## Architecture

The image is [`coding-runtime`](https://github.com/language-operator/coding-runtime)
plus the opencode CLI. The base owns the OS layer, the web terminal (xterm.js over
a node-pty WebSocket bridge, with a cross-origin guard and a 25s keepalive), `tini`,
and the ETL that turns the operator's `/etc/agent/config.yaml` into a normalized
config. What lives here is the three files that describe opencode to it:

- **`runtime.json`** — the manifest: where config goes (`$STATE_DIR/opencode`),
  the serving surface, and how tmux launches the TUI.
- **`emit.mjs`** — the emitter: normalized config → `opencode.jsonc` (provider,
  model, MCP servers). Agent **instructions** are written to `instructions.md` and
  referenced from opencode's `instructions` field, so they load as standing context
  for every session — no async seeding, no timing.
- **`launch-opencode.sh`** — what tmux runs. The base has already set the working
  directory (the cloned repo when the agent sets `spec.repository`, else
  `/workspace`), so it opens that project directly. It also passes `--continue` once
  the workspace holds a session store, so an agent that is put to sleep and woken —
  a new pod, and with it a new tmux server — resumes the conversation rather than
  opening blank.

One container, running the base entrypoint: resolve the environment, seed config,
serve. Seeding runs in the agent container rather than an init container because
the operator mounts `/tmp` there only, so the two would share no writable path.
tmux keeps the session alive across browser reconnects.

The sibling [`claude-code-adapter`](https://github.com/language-operator/claude-code-adapter)
is the same shape on the same base, swapping the CLI and the three files.

## Install

Prerequisite: the [`language-operator`](https://github.com/language-operator/language-operator)
chart must be installed first — it provides the `LanguageAgentRuntime` CRD.

```bash
helm install opencode oci://ghcr.io/language-operator/charts/opencode \
  --namespace language-operator
```

Then reference it from a `LanguageAgent`:

```yaml
apiVersion: langop.io/v1alpha1
kind: LanguageAgent
metadata:
  name: my-agent
spec:
  runtime: opencode
```

## Authentication

The runtime sets `auth.enabled: true`, so access is gated entirely by the cluster's
OIDC proxy: when the `LanguageCluster` has auth enabled the operator injects an
oauth2-proxy sidecar in front of the terminal. There is no built-in password — if
the cluster does not enable auth, the terminal is exposed unauthenticated on its
ingress. opencode itself reaches the model gateway via the provider config in
`opencode.jsonc`; no interactive login is needed.

## Development

```bash
make build      # docker build -t ghcr.io/language-operator/opencode-adapter:latest .
make test       # build, then run the coding-runtime conformance suite
make publish    # build and push the image to ghcr.io
make dev        # build, import into k3s, and upgrade the runtime release (inner loop)

helm lint chart
helm template opencode chart
```

## CI

- `build-image.yaml` — builds and pushes the image to `ghcr.io` on push to `main` and `v*` tags.
- `release-chart.yaml` — packages `chart/` and pushes it to `oci://ghcr.io/language-operator/charts`.
- `test.yaml` — builds the image, runs the `coding-runtime` conformance suite against
  it under the operator's posture (read-only root, uid 1000, all capabilities dropped),
  and lints/templates the chart on every PR. The suite is taken out of the image rather
  than fetched, so the checks always match the runtime being checked, and no failures are
  tolerated.
